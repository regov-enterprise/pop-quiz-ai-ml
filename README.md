## Rationale

<p>The Internet has a weaklink that is long overdue for a complete overhaul. It is considered unfashionable as modern softwares still continues to use the same centralise data structures (Databases) while unable to guarantee its safety. </br> Central databases are housed in or by a central provider, and thus they own and control the records in them. </br> In other words, the personal and confidential information of a user provided during onbaording registration on any online platform is actually at the mercy of the platform owners. <p/>

<p> This has caused unimaginable risk to users across the world, in particular the cases of hacks and data bridges on banks and financial insitution globally re-occuring. </br> Even more, personal data loss for anyone increase the risks of identity theft or infringement on many fronts: health, financial, business and on many personal endeavours, which is tool for continuous exploitation even after the bridge is resolved. <p/>

<p> Web3.0 is a paradigm shift from the current internet, which is considered as Web2.0. </br> It intends to give users more control over their personal information on the internet. Companies will no longer be able to control the personal data on their online platforms nor will they have the explicit authority to share, extract or manipulate them. </br> A user will have complete ownership of their data, a mantra culmunating to the Self-soverign Identity (SSI) blockchain. </br> SSI powers the Web3.0 revolution. The paradigm shift gives rise to the adoption of SSI identity by many companies and service provider. In order to embody the qualities of Web3.0, SSI identity is the way to go. <p/>
