## Welcome to this ML PopQuiz!
### { "Engineer": "AI Machine Learning" }

Hey! We are excited that you are interested in joining the team at Regov Technologies.

We feel that the best way for you to produce your best codes is when you hit flow in your comfort zone. Therefore, this is a pop-quiz for you to demonstrate your problem solving skills and understanding of key concepts in your toolbox. This test should not take you a long amount of time to complete. The questions are open to interpretation and implementation.

You have two questions to attempt.

## Question 1

<**Requirement** : <p> Implement minimum of four(4) contraints of your choice.</p>

<p> Machine learning has changed the how we analyse, process and use data in decision making. As a ML engineer, provide technical implementation of your own rationale to seolve the following. 
</P>

<p>
Design and implement a Python-based machine learning solution for real-time anomaly detection in time series data generated from multiple sensors. The algorithm should identify and classify unusual patterns or events that deviate significantly from the expected behavior in the given dataset. Consider the following requirements and constraints while developing your solution:

1. Data Preprocessing: Implement a method to clean, preprocess, and transform the raw sensor data into a suitable format for further analysis. This may include handling missing values, smoothing, and normalization.

2. Feature Extraction: Develop techniques to extract relevant features from the time series data, such as statistical measures (mean, variance, etc.), frequency domain features (Fourier transform), or wavelet coefficients.

3. Model Selection: Compare and evaluate various machine learning algorithms, such as clustering, classification, or deep learning models, to choose the most appropriate approach for the given problem. Justify your choice based on the algorithm's performance, interpretability, and computational efficiency.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the selected model's hyperparameters to improve its anomaly detection performance using techniques like grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization.

5. Model Evaluation: Design a robust evaluation strategy to measure the performance of your anomaly detection solution, considering metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.

6. Scalability and Real-time Processing: Ensure that your solution can efficiently handle large-scale datasets and real-time streaming data, taking into account potential bottlenecks and computational constraints.

7. Visualization and Alerting: Develop a user-friendly interface to visualize the detected anomalies and provide an alerting mechanism to notify the relevant stakeholders when an anomaly is identified.

8. Model Maintenance: Propose a strategy to periodically update and retrain the model as new data becomes available, ensuring its continued effectiveness in detecting anomalies.

</p>


## Question 2

<**Requirement** : <p>: Implement Constraint 1,2, 6, and any other two (2) of your choice.<p>
<p>
You have been tasked to design and implement a backend API solution for an e-commerce. Feel free to use any architectural pattern, design pattern, and python  framework. Take into account the following business requirements and constraints.
</p>

1. User Authentication and Authorization: Implement a user authentication and authorization system, supporting features such as registration, login, and password management.

2. Product Catalog Management: Develop product catalog feature, allowing for the creation, updating, deletion, and retrieval of product information, such as names, descriptions, images, categories, and pricing.

3. Inventory Management: Design an inventory management system to track and update the stock levels of products in real-time, ensuring accurate information is available to both customers and administrators.

4. Order Processing and Fulfillment: Create an API to handle customer orders, including the placement, payment, shipping, and tracking of orders, as well as the processing of returns and refunds.

5. Search and Recommendation: Implement search functionality that allows customers to quickly find and discover products based on various criteria, such as keywords, categories, or personalized recommendations.

6. Performance and Scalability: Ensure that the backend API can handle a high volume of concurrent requests and scale horizontally to accommodate the growing user base and product catalog.

7. Data Persistence and Caching: Optimize data storage and retrieval using appropriate databases (e.g., relational, NoSQL), and implement caching mechanisms to improve performance and reduce latency.

8. Integration with Third-Party Services: Design the API to seamlessly integrate with third-party services, such as payment gateways, shipping providers, and marketing tools, to support the platform's end-to-end operations.

9. Monitoring and Logging: Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging capabilities to track API performance, usage, and errors, enabling rapid identification and resolution of issues.

10. Documentation and Testing: Provide clear and concise API documentation to facilitate easy integration with frontend applications and other systems, and ensure thorough testing of the API to validate functionality and performance under various conditions.

### Notes

- Use Python
- Use Git API V3 or above
- Dockerise the application
- Apply your preferred coding structure
- Unit test is an added advantage
- Adda  README
- Writing design documents will attract extra points
- Solving / attempting all the questions beyond the minium requirements is an added advantage  :)
